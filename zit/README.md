# Zit Web Component Library

The name is a variation on "Lit", which is another web component library.

Zit aims to be simpler and smaller than Lit, with fewer capabilities.
The main features are:

- no tooling required
- no build process required
- automatic wiring of event handlers
- automatic reactivity

The library is entirely implemented in the file `counters/zit-element.js`.
See example usage in `counters/counter.zit.js`.
